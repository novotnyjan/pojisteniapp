Practice Django project.

The application serves as a simple CRUD tool for managing an "insurence" database.

The Django Project consists of three models: Type of Insurance, Instance of Insurance and Insurants.

The application then enables the user to create, update and delete data in the database.

Project is in debug mode, so to run it, simply navigate to the parent folder and execute command:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
within environment with Django installed.
